abstract = {Renewable energy techniques are now gaining more and more attention as the years pass by, not only because of the threat of climate change but also, e.g. due to serious pollution problems in some countries and because the renewable energy technologies have matured and can be depended upon an increasing degree. The energy from ocean waves bares tremendous potential as a source of renewable energy, and the related technologies have continually been improved during the last decades. In this paper, different types of wave energy converters are classified by their mechanical structure and how they absorb energy from ocean waves. The paper presents a review of strategies for electrical control of wave energy converters as well as energy storage techniques. Strategies of electrical control are used to achieve a higher energy absorption, and they are also of interest because of the large variety among different strategies. Furthermore, the control strategies strongly affect the complexity of both the mechanical and the electrical system, thus not only impacting energy absorption but also robustness, survivability, maintenance requirements and thus in the end the cost of electricity from ocean waves.}
