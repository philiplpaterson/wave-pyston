author = {Tom, Nathan},
abstractNote = {While the field of wave energy has been the subject of numerical simulation, scale model testing, and precommercial project testing for decades, wave energy technologies remain in the early stages of development and must continuing proving themselves as a promising modern renewable energy field. One of the difficulties that wave energy systems have been struggling to overcome is the design of highly efficient energy conversion systems that can convert the mechanical power, derived from the oscillation of wave activated bodies, into another useful product. Often the power take-off (PTO) is defined as the single unit responsible for converting mechanical power into another usable form such as electricity, pressurized fluid, compressed air, and others. The PTO, and the entire power conversion chain (PCC), is of great importance as it affects not only how efficient wave power is converted into electricity, but also contributes to the mass, size, structural dynamics, and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the wave energy converter (WEC). Unlike wind and solar, there is no industrial standard device, or devices, for wave energy conversion and this diversity is transferred to the PTO system. The majority of current WEC PTO systems incorporate a mechanical or hydraulic drive train, power generator, and an electrical control system. The challenge of WEC PTO designs is designing a mechanical-to-electrical component that can efficiently convert irregular, bi-directional, low frequency and low alternating velocity wave motions. While gross average power levels can be predicted in advance, the variable wave elevation input has to be converted into smooth electrical output and hence usually necessitates some type of energy storage system, such as battery storage, accumulator super capacitors, etc., or other means of compensation such as an array of devices. One of the primary challenges for wave energy converter systems is the fluctuating nature of wave resources, which require WEC components to be designed to handle loads (i.e. torques, forces, and powers) that are many times greater than the average load. This approach requires a much greater PTO capacity than the average power output and indicates a higher cost. In addition, supporting mechanical coupling and or gearing can be added to the PCC to help alleviate the difficulties with transmission and control of fluctuating large loads with low frequencies (indicative of wave forcing) into smaller loads at higher frequencies (optimum for conventional electrical machine design) can quickly increase the complexity of the PCC which could result in a greater number of failure modes and increased maintenance costs. All of the previous points demonstrate how the PTO influences WEC dynamics, reliability, performance and cost which are critical design factors. This paper further explores these topics by providing a review of the state-of-the-art PTO systems currently under development, how these novel PTO systems are tested and derisked prior to precommercial deployment, and the evaluation metrics historically used to differentiate between PTO designs and how they can be improved to support control co-design focused development of wave energy systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The level of awareness about ocean wave energy as a viable source of useful energy has been increasing recently. Different concepts and methods have been suggested by many researchers to harvest ocean wave energy. This paper reviews and compares the efficiencies and power performance of different wave energy converters. The types of analyses used in deriving the reported efficiencies are identified, and the stage of the power conversion processes at which the efficiencies were determined is also identified. In order to find a common way to compare the efficiencies of different technologies, the hydrodynamic efficiency in relation to the characteristic width of the wave energy converters and the wave resource potential are chosen in this paper. The results show that the oscillating body systems have the highest ratio in terms of the efficiency per characteristic width, and overtopping devices have the lowest. In addition, with better understanding of the devices&rsquo; dynamics, the efficiencies of the newer oscillating water column and body systems would increase as the potential wave energy level increases, which shows that those newer designs could be suitable for more potential locations with large variations in wave energy potentials. At last, discussion about the cost of ocean wave energy is presented as well.},

    abstract = { AbstractOcean waves are a huge, largely untapped energy resource, and the potential for extracting energy from waves is considerable. Research in this area is driven by the need to meet renewable energy targets, but is relatively immature compared to other renewable energy technologies. This review introduces the general status of wave energy and evaluates the device types that represent current wave energy converter (WEC) technology, particularly focusing on work being undertaken within the United Kingdom. The possible power take-off systems are identified, followed by a consideration of some of the control strategies to enhance the efficiency of point absorber-type WECs. There is a lack of convergence on the best method of extracting energy from the waves and, although previous innovation has generally focused on the concept and design of the primary interface, questions arise concerning how best to optimize the powertrain. This article concludes with some suggestions of future developments. }

ABSTRACT = {The traditional wave energy converters (WECs) use hydraulic or turbine-type power take-off (PTO) mechanisms which consist of many moving parts, creating mechanical complexity and increasing the installation and maintenance costs. Linear generator-based direct-drive WECs could be a solution to overcome this problem, but the efficiency of the single conventional linear generator is not high enough, and it cannot work satisfactorily in the low-frequency range. This article reviews the recent research developments of the linear permanent magnet (PM) generator-based WEC to harness maximum energy from ocean waves. It starts with a brief introduction and background of wave energy converters using linear generators. Following this, the working principle of the WECs with linear PM generators is briefly outlined. Subsequently, the analytical model of the linear PM generator-based WEC is studied. After that, the up-to-date developments of the linear PM generator-based PTO systems are studied. Despite some modifications resulting in complexity in the linear PM generator&rsquo;s structure and a rise in manufacturing costs, the study shows the systems&rsquo; efficiencies increased by increasing magnetic flux and reducing cogging force. The key parameters and improvement issues that can increase the performances and efficiencies of the PTO systems are identified to help future researchers for further development. Moreover, the review discusses the numerical and experimental analysis tools, the typical control systems used by the researchers and the challenges of the linear generator-based wave energy conversion system. Finally, conclusions about the significant beneficial characteristics and design choice of the WEC linear generator structure are provided and related to the application conditions.},

abstract = {Many devices have been proposed for generating electricity from the oscillatory motion of a floating body in waves which are generally irregular. This study undertakes numerical modelling and small-scale experimental testing of a power take-off system for a heaving float. A power take off system is employed to provide high speed rotational input to a standard induction generator. A numerical model of the coupled hydrodynamic and electrical system is described with particular focus on the effect of generator control strategy on the time-varying response and power output of the system. The numerical model with three empirical hydrodynamic coefficients is calibrated against experimental measurements in regular waves. The control method includes a static characteristic and a proportional integral (PI) controller to maximise average power output whilst reducing the peak rate of change of torque in the driveshaft compared to a system with no control applied. The control strategy is implemented within a model drive-train with a geometric scale of 1:67. Experimental tests are reported and model predictions of time-varying response have a form similar to the measured response. Average power output from irregular waves is predicted within 11% for frequencies less than 1.3Hz (periods greater than 6.3s full scale) and wave heights greater than 30mm (2m full scale).}

abstract = {Many wave energy converters have been developed in the past century with various power takeoff systems, including those devices with air turbines, linear electromagnetic motors, and hydroelectric components. Although these systems have their own advantages, power takeoffs are still recognized as the most important challenge in ocean wave energy technology. In this paper, a mechanical motion rectifier (MMR) based power takeoff system is proposed and prototyped for wave energy converter. This power takeoff system can convert the bidirectional wave motion into unidirectional rotation of generator by integrating two one-way bearings into a rack pinion system. A wave energy converter which contains a 1.2m buoy and MMR based power takeoff system was designed and fabricated in this paper. The models of power takeoff system and single-body wave energy converter were built and analyzed. The simulation results in regular wave show that MMR based power takeoff can produce more power comparing with linear damping power takeoff system and the optimal PTO damping of MMR system is smaller than that of linear damping system. Lab testing of power takeoff mechanism and ocean testing of the overall ocean wave converter system were also conducted to validate the concept of MMR design. The disengagement and engagement of one-way bearings in the mechanical motion rectifier system were verified in both lab and ocean test.}

abstract = {Renewable energy techniques are now gaining more and more attention as the years pass by, not only because of the threat of climate change but also, e.g. due to serious pollution problems in some countries and because the renewable energy technologies have matured and can be depended upon an increasing degree. The energy from ocean waves bares tremendous potential as a source of renewable energy, and the related technologies have continually been improved during the last decades. In this paper, different types of wave energy converters are classified by their mechanical structure and how they absorb energy from ocean waves. The paper presents a review of strategies for electrical control of wave energy converters as well as energy storage techniques. Strategies of electrical control are used to achieve a higher energy absorption, and they are also of interest because of the large variety among different strategies. Furthermore, the control strategies strongly affect the complexity of both the mechanical and the electrical system, thus not only impacting energy absorption but also robustness, survivability, maintenance requirements and thus in the end the cost of electricity from ocean waves.}
